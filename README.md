# Instructions

**Install Homebrew**

/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" 

**Install SDL2**

brew install sdl2

brew install sdl2_image

brew install sdl2_mixer

brew install sdl2_net

**Install TiMIDIty** (for Music)

brew install timidity

**Copy the DOOM.WAD (IWAD) to the Applications Support sub-folder**

In **Terminal** the full path will look like the below:

/Users/%USERNAME%/Library/Application\ Support/prboom-plus/doom.wad

**Note**: 'doom.wad' and 'DOOM.WAD' are different filenames, as macOS and OS X are case sensitive!

Then run **./prboom-plus** after compiling it, if it does not run right-click upon the binary executable and then click Open.

**Install EAWPats** (for Sound/Music Instrument Patch support, for example), and then copy 'timidity.cfg' to the ./prboom-plus binary executables location, and edit 'timidity.cfg' to point to dir ./EAWPats at the two locations within the file that are commented and described as such. (Assuming ./EAWPats is a sub-folder within the ./prboom-plus folder).

# Latest News

I'll have to figure out a way to upload it later...
